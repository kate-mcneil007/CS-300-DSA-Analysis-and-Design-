# CS-300-DSA-Analysis-and-Design-

- What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

Throughout the course we were working to create a system that stores, sorts, and prints various course information. Before project one we created pseudocode and flowcharts outlining the flow of logic for this system. We passed the pseudocode in in project one. We also analyzed various run times for different data structures to determine which would be the best fit for ABCU. In project two an actual system was created to display a menu, upload a file, and perform various tasks. The logic outlined in the pseudocode and flowcharts was taken and applied to create working code. Based off of project one, I decided to use a vector to store and sort ABCUâ€™s data. 

- How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached the problem one step at a time. It was very helpful to analyze various data structures before determining which one I wanted to use for the final project. Creating pseudocode for the data structures also helped a lot as it worked as a blueprint for the actual code. The flowcharts really helped me understand the logic of the various data structures as it forced me to walk through each step and analyze exactly what was going on. It is important to understand data structures in order to make educated decisions on which is the best choice for your work. It is also important to understand the logic of them as memory and efficiency can be improved by them when used correctly. 

- How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

While working on my activities and projects I referenced my textbook quite a bit. As more activities were completed I frequently looked back on them. For instance. The logic for sorting used in the final project was similar to that done in a previous activity. By referencing the textbook as well as prior created work, the projects came together much easier. I also found the C++ reference website very helpful as it provides a large range of information. 

- How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

These projects improved my understanding of data structures considerably. Due to this I am much more comfortable with them and my knowledge has expanded. This will help with my developing skills as well as prepare me for developing programs in the future. 

- How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project has helped me become more aware of the importance of documenting my work. It also helped my think more about the order in which functions and such should be set up. I spent a lot of time in the final project organizing my work to make it as easy to read as possible. This course helped me achieve this.
